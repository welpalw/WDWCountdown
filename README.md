<h1>Walt Disney World Countdown Timer<h1>
<h3>
<p>This is a simple vacation countdown timer to be used by my clients (I own a travel agency) so they can count down
the days to their Walt Disney World Vacation.  Also included is a current 7-day weather forecast that clients can
use prior to their vacation so they are aware of current weather conditions.</p>
</h3>

<h1>Project Features<h1>
  <h3>
<p>1.Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event): The user selects a vacation start date and the app displays the days remaining until that vacation.</p>
<p>2. Visualize data in a user friendly way. (e.g. graph, chart, etc.): The data is displayed in a box using my agency font families and color palette.</p>
<p>3. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app: The weather forecast widget is called from Visual Crossing Weather API.</p>
<p>4. Implement modern interactive UI features (e.g. table/data sorting, autocomplete, drag-and-drop, calendar-date-picker, etc.):  A calendar date-picker, as well as a manual date entry, is used.</p>
